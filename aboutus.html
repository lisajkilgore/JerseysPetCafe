Jersey's Pet Cafe is named after our wonderful, spirited, fluffy, sweet Jersey. When we adopted her from the Human Society, she rescued us just as much as we rescued her. We can't imagine life without her. She is part of our family. We know a lot of people feel the same way about their beloved furry family members. For that reason, we wanted to create a cafe for you and them. 
</p>
<p>
Jersey LOVES all humans and will unselfishly roll over for all to pet her belly, for as long as possible. Ironically, Jersey does not like any other animals. Therefore, she will never be able to make an appearance at the cafe during business hours when other furry guests are present.

<p>
We hope you enjoy your time here, and will return often.
